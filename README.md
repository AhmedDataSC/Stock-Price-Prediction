## 📝 **Project Summary & Achievement: Google Stock Price Prediction with RNN**

### 📌 **Objective:**

To build a machine learning model using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** layers to predict future stock prices based on historical Google stock data.

---

### ✅ **What You Accomplished**

#### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

* Successfully loaded and processed historical stock data from `Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv` and `Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv`.
* Applied **feature scaling** using `MinMaxScaler` to normalize the stock prices in the range of 0 to 1 — a critical step for improving the performance of neural networks.
* Engineered **time-series input sequences** (with 60 timesteps) to train the LSTM model to recognize temporal patterns in stock prices.

#### 2. **Model Design & Training**

* Built a **deep RNN with four stacked LSTM layers** and applied **dropout regularization** to prevent overfitting.
* Used the **Adam optimizer** and **mean squared error** as the loss function to efficiently minimize prediction error.
* Trained the model over multiple epochs using a defined batch size — allowing the model to learn long-term dependencies from the input data.

#### 3. **Testing & Prediction**

* Prepared the test set in a way that respects the temporal structure (using the last 60 days from training + test period).
* Made predictions on the 2017 Google stock prices using the trained LSTM model.
* **Inverse transformed** the predictions back to the original scale to compare with real stock prices.

#### 4. **Visualization**

* Created a **line plot** to visually compare:

  * 🔴 Real Google stock prices (2017)
  * 🔵 Predicted Google stock prices (by the model)
* The chart gives a **visual validation** of the model’s predictive capability and shows how closely the model tracked the real stock movement.
